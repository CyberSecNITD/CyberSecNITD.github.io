      <description>Okay, we were shut for a very long time! Our founders graduated, things were dormant. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a change.
It all started with conversation with a freshman, I told them we had a club and probably we can do a meetup to bring it back. So, I decided to start with a new workshop series which I have given the name - &amp;ldquo;Segfault&amp;rdquo;.
Segfault will be a series of workshops on reverse engineering.</description>
