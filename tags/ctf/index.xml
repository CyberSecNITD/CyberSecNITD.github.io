      <description>The time has come to do it again!
Root CTF, a CTF event organized by CyberSecNITD every year in TerraTechnica NITD&amp;rsquo;s Annual Techfest.
The CTF was Jeopardy style and was conducted in offline mode.
We witnessed 11 teams having students from NITD and from other Colleges too. That was a huge progress for us from RootCTF17 where all our participants were students from NITD only.
Since last year&amp;rsquo;s CTF, we got the opportunity to learn more on topics in CyberSecurity.</description>
