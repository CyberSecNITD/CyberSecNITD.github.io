      <title>Reversing a C program</title>

      <description>Reversing a C Program It&amp;rsquo;s said C is low level programming language, well that&amp;rsquo;s not true. It became that way because of advancements in new programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby. These run on a VM, thereby incur a heavy abstraction cost.
Now C programs are compiled to assembly, since C have not much syntax sugar it become easy to read the Assembly and figure out the possible C code to it.</description>

      <title>Segfault - Reverse Engineering Workshop series</title>

      <description>Okay, we were shut for a very long time! Our founders graduated, things were dormant. It&amp;rsquo;s time for a change.
It all started with conversation with a freshman, I told them we had a club and probably we can do a meetup to bring it back. So, I decided to start with a new workshop series which I have given the name - &amp;ldquo;Segfault&amp;rdquo;.
Segfault will be a series of workshops on reverse engineering.</description>

      <title>CyberSecNITD meetup with IEEE NITD student branch</title>
      <link>https://cybersec.upvision.co/events/feb19ieeemeetup/</link>

      <description>Today we collaborated with IEEE NITD Student Branch and organized a Introductory workshop.
Since being an independent club with students of common interest we thought it would be better if we do some serious workshop helping the freshman year students jump into the CyberSecurity Band Wagon!
The crowd we received was impressive! We never had a meetup with such a huge crowd before.
Since we are bunch of students with mediocre GPA trying to bust our keyboard typing out cryptic words what we describe as commands on dumb boring terminal doesn&amp;rsquo;t easily qualify as a Club with organization and publicity, today was important.</description>

      <description>The time has come to do it again!
Root CTF, a CTF event organized by CyberSecNITD every year in TerraTechnica NITD&amp;rsquo;s Annual Techfest.
The CTF was Jeopardy style and was conducted in offline mode.
We witnessed 11 teams having students from NITD and from other Colleges too. That was a huge progress for us from RootCTF17 where all our participants were students from NITD only.
Since last year&amp;rsquo;s CTF, we got the opportunity to learn more on topics in CyberSecurity.</description>
